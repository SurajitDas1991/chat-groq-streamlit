# Streamlit app to check out GROQ API inference.

- Uses Ollama Llama3.1 embeddings and llama-3.1-8b-instant from Chatgroq.
- The data is scraped from a website using Langchain web base loader.
- Streamlit is used to provide the UI.

Observations:

- The groq api is meant to be fast - that has not been my experience but could be related to my laptop hardware limitations running on a Lenovo Legion Y740-15ICH (i7-8750H, RTX 2070 Max-Q)
